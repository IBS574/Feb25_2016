if (length(arg)== 0){
  stop('Stop: n files entered')
}
```

```{r make quality data.frame}
qqF <- qa(arg) #quality assessment
qqf.pc.qual <- qqF[["perCycle"]]$quality
```

```{r create graphics device and output to file}
pdf("q-graph.pdf")
print(ShortRead:::.plotCycleQuality(qqf.pc.qual))
dev.off()
```
